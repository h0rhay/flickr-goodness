# flickr-goodness

- A responsive Flickr gallery with lazy loading and tag search functionality
- Using front end build stuff like:
-- gulp
-- sass
-- require with browserify
-- and some simple templating with mustache js

I've published the project here:
http://codepen.io/h0rhay/full/ZGNQeo/
Plese not the code here is browser ready. Check out the repo for the real build scaffold.

Enjoy ;)
